# Features

Organize code by feature/domain for complex features that include multiple components, hooks, and logic.

## Structure:
```
auth/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── services/
└── types/
```

This feature-based structure is ideal for large applications where grouping by feature makes more sense than by type.
